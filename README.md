# Mazedoku generator

A generator for Mazedoku puzzles, a kinda of Sudoko variant invent by Reddit user Chandranel_.

Fill in the empty spaces in the grid according to the following rules:

  1. Each corridor of length N must contain the digits between 1 and N.
  2. Any two cells that are a Chess knight's move apart cannot contain the same number.

Note that corridors are horizontal or vertical sequences of two or more connected cells, which are delimited by walls.
Within a grid row or column (spanning the entire height or width of the grid), duplicate digits may appear.
